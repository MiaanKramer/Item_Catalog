# Item Catalog (By Miaan Kramer)
## Udacity Project (Full Stack Nano Degree)

### Project Description:
- I need to develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items. Requirements include:

- A homepage displaying all current categories along with the latest added items.
- Selecting a specific category shows you all the items available for that category.
- Selecting a specific item shows you specific information of that item.
- After logging in, a user has the ability to add, update, or delete item info.
- The application provides a JSON endpoint, at the very least.
- Write your Flask application locally in the vagrant/catalog directory (which will automatically be synced to /vagrant/catalog within the VM).
- Run your application within the VM (python /vagrant/catalog/application.py)
- Access and test your application by visiting http://localhost:8005 locally

## How To Run The Application

### Prerequisites:
- Git
- Vagrant
- VirtualBox

A example environment file has been provided to show what variables need to be entered in order for the application to run successfully.
